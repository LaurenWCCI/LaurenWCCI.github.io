        <h3>Experience</h3>
        
        <h4>Upstart</h4>
        <h5>March 2022 - Feb 2023</h5>
        <h5>Software Engineer</h5>
        <p>Worked on a team that launched a new product in July 2022. Developed software with front-end 
        (JS React, HTML Slim, JS Angular and TypeScript) back-end (Ruby on Rails and Kotlin with SpringBoot) 
        code bases. Worked on features related to loan approval processes. Some work was in greenfield 
        space (Kotlin), but much was in a pre-existing monolith (Ruby). To be successful in this role, I 
        had to learn Kotlin. My work was split across three repositories of code: a ruby monolith, the 
        kotlin microservice, and the TypeScript user-facing front-end.</p>

        <h4>Root Insurance Company</h4>
        <h5>Feb 2021 - Jan 2022</h5>
        <h5>Software Engineer I</h5>
        <p>Worked both with front-end (JavaScript React) and back-end (Ruby on Rails) code bases. Developed 
            and shipped a feature that took in a prior address from a user (added scenes to the mobile 
            storybook and application as well as columns to a database to store the new data). Developed and 
            shipped a feature that took in and used a secondary report when the primary report did not 
            contain enough information for pricing. Developed (not completed) a feature with the ability for 
            location information to be included for each vehicle on record (added column to database, added 
            accessibility to edit on admin pages).
